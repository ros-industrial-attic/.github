# ROS-Industrial Attic

Welcome to the ROS-Industrial Attic GitHub organisation.

## Purpose

The ROS-Industrial project (NA, EU and APAC) uses this organisation to host repositories of projects that are no longer under development and/or are no longer supported.

[*Archiving*](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) such repositories would make it impossible for community members to interact with each other or to coordinate community-driven development, which is why this dedicated GitHub organisation was created instead.

Please feel free to post on issue trackers and discussion boards, however do keep in mind [those are not being monitored actively anymore](#issue-trackers-and-pull-requests).

## Status of repositories

All repositories hosted by this GitHub organisation are end-of-life.

Many will also be unsupported.

As a consequence, no active development takes place in any of these repositories, and the ROS-Industrial project will also not dedicate any resources to maintenance any longer.

Any references to (previous) maintainers or authors are kept purely for archival purposes.
They are under no obligation to respond to user requests for support.

### Finding active forks

If you are interested in any particular repository, you are encouraged to investigate whether there are any active *forks* using GitHub's [Network Graph](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories) functionality and pages.

## Issue trackers and Pull Requests

Issue trackers and Pull Request queues have been left open to facilitate community interaction.
PRs will however most likely not be reviewed by ROS-Industrial project developers, nor will they be necessarilly be merged.
